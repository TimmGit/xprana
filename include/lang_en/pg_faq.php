						<h2>What is a microblog?</h2>
						<p>As the name suggests, a microblog is a miniature blog. Just like a regular blog, you can share thoughts, stories, knowledge and content, but in a much more condensed fashion.</p>
						<p>With Microblogging, there is no need to write lengthy, descriptive posts.  However, with a 160 character limit, choose your words carefully.  With microblogging, you can simply say things like: “working on the updated spreadsheet” or “going out for coffee” and avoid more formal means of messaging, such as email.</p>
						<p>Microblogging will allow you to follow your friends and make new friends with different or similar interests.  This new type of communication enables you to manage your dashboard and keep tabs on the everyday lives of your friends, family and colleagues in one convenient location.</p>

						<h2>What is <a href="'.SITEURL.'">'.SITE_TITLE.'</a> and why should I register here?</h2>
						<p><a href="'.SITEURL.'">'.SITE_TITLE.'</a> is a microblogging community used to share brief messages to those who are following you.  You can also "follow" all the people important to you, and read all of their updates in one, convenient location . When you <!--REGLINK-->Register<!--/REGLINK-->, you obtain a unique name and address – something like user: http://username.'.DOMAIN.' or http://'.DOMAIN.'/user that leads to your personal homepage. From here, you have the ability to use your homepage to create your own microblogs, and follow the microblogs of your friends and colleagues.</p>
						
						<a name="friends"></a>
						<h2>How can I start following friends and colleagues? </h2>
						<p> To follow a friend, go to their profile and click the “Follow” Button, located under the profile picture.  Once you click, “Follow” this contact will be added to your list of friends.  The process is one sided – no need for your friend to authorize.  Your friend’s microblogs will appear in a tab in your profile called “With Friends”.  If your friends don’t have a profile in <a href="'.SITEURL.'">'.SITE_TITLE.'</a>, - invite them</p>
						
						<a name="invite"></a>
						<h2>How can I invite a friend?</h2>
						<p>There are many ways to invite a friend.  We recommend using the Invite Form on our site which can be found here: <a href="'.SITEURL.'invite">'.SITEURL.'invite</a></p>
						
						<a name="tags"></a>
						<h2>What are tags in the user profile used for?</h2>
						<p>Each user can add up to 10 tags in their profile.  These tags can describe that user’s interest, hobbies, profession, expertise, work experience, etc.  When you click a tag, you will go to a list aggregating all the users on the site with that Tag.  This is a way to easily find people with similar interests and quickly build your  friend’s list.</p>
						
						<a name="tabs"></a>
						<h2>What are the tabs that I see in my profile?</h2>
						<p>In the tab <!--TB_OU--><b>Only&nbsp;<!--R_NICKNAME-->Nickname<!--/R_NICKNAME--></b><!--/TB_OU--> you will find posts only from this profile. You will find the same tab in the other peoples’ profiles.</P>
						<P>The tab <!--TB_WFR--><b>With&nbsp;friends</b><!--/TB_WFR-->contains all of that person’s interaction with other users. The other 3 tabs are personal tabs, which will be only be visible to you, on your profile. </p>
						<P><!--TB_IFM--><b>@<!--R_NICKNAME-->Nickname<!--/R_NICKNAME--></b><!--/TB_IFM--> contains posts that mention your user name with the @ sign in front of it. Respectively, if you write @username (example @Phil) of another username, the user will see the post written by you in his or her @Nickname section. </p>
						<P>In the tab <!--TB_FAV--><b>Favorite</b><!--/TB_FAV--> you will find posts that you have marked as favorite . You can mark a post as a favorite by clicking the star right next to it.  </p>
						<P>In the tab <!--TB_DIR--><b>Directly addressed</b><!--/TB_DIR--> you will find direct messages from other users on the system. This is personal correspondence and is not visible to other users. When you receive a post addressed to you, you can respond to it either by clicking the Respond icon or by selecting the button ”Write&nbsp;to&nbsp;user" from that user’s profile.</p>
		
						<a name="homemsg"></a>
						<h2>Why aren\'t all messages visible on the home page?</h2>
						<p>Because of a criteria filter, all posts will not appear on the homepage.  If there were no criteria filters, there would simply be too many messages and spam in one place.</p>
						
						<a name="rss"></a>
						<h2>What type of RSS feeds does the site have?</h2>
						<p>There is an RSS feed for each user’s profile.  You can follow any user via RSS to an external RSS reader.</p>
